Build an enclosure
==================

You'll need:

* a laser cutting machine, often available in your local FabLab / Hackerspace,
* 5mm plywood,
* wood glue (glue everything except the top panel).

The size of the enclosure is 220x110x40mm.

Here are the SVG files that you can download and use with your laser cutter:
