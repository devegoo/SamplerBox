3. Align 40-pin connector and stand-offs with Raspberry Pi. Push PCBs together, applying force near standoffs, applying pressure to pin headers without bending the boards.

4. Secure Raspberry Pi to SamplerBox standoffs using enclosed M3 screws.

5. Insert SD card with image and USB stick with samples into Raspberry Pi.

6. Use a standard stereo cable or headphones to connect to the balanced audio output.

.. warning::
    Connecting both line out and headphones simultaneously is not recommended and may result in degraded sound quality.

7. Connect USB MIDI to Raspberry Pi USB port or serial MIDI to MIDI IN DIN port.

8. Connect power adapter to Micro USB port on SamplerBox. SamplerBox will power Raspberry Pi via GPIO connector.

.. warning::
    Keep MicroUSB port on Raspberry Pi unconnected.
