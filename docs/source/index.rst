SamplerBox
**********

SamplerBox is a pocket-sized sound module based on `Raspberry Pi <https://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_ for use with MIDI devices in your bedroom, studio, or on the stage.
It is completely open-source which means it is forever evolving, making it a formidable alternative to other commercial MIDI samplers and expanders on the market.

How it works
============

SamplerBox uses MIDI messages from a connected MIDI keyboard or device to trigger digital audio samples (wave files) which are then converted to
an analogue audio signal. The software has been designed to run on `Raspberry Pi <https://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_ single-board computers. A single-board computer is a tiny computer
that contains a CPU processor, GPU, ROM, RAM, Ethernet, USB and HDMI ports. They can be programmed to do almost anything: run an operating system,
operate a security system, navigate aircraft, take over the world. In the case of SamplerBox its sole purpose is to play music!

Once SamplerBox is running, it will find sample-set directories on a connected USB drive and add them to a setlist. SamplerBox will then attempt to load sample files based on a file naming convention
or filenames and rules defined in a :ref:`definition.txt file <definition-files>`.
